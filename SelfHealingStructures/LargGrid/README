Create a self healing grid where the "units" or "squares" are bigger then the EventWindow.

Any Junction object will act as a seed to create a Grid accross the entire world.

If this grid is "nuked" it will heal. If one nuke does not start the healing process,
nuke it again. A series of "nukes" will usually not destroy the entire grid, it usually gets into a healing state.

A result of this change is the Grid no longer has a mechanisum for, but still supports, controling its total size (not the unit size).

A result of this change is the Grid no longer supports controlling its total size (not the unit size). The Grid is now a structured
ForkBomb where the size can only be controled by limiting available resources (Res). Perhaps this is how it should work, I dont know.
This same change made the Grid extremmly robust once created.

With Large unit sizes the size of the "nuked" space is too small to effect a grid with large unit sizes, perhaps this is a scaling issue,
but I believe once the Grid is created only huge end-to-end deletions can harm it.
