Thoughts about a Piano Seed.
I do Not want to have to provide all Notes I would like them crated on the fly.

To get the correct frequencies
There is math that will do it captured in ScaleFrequencies.cpp.

Hard code the Seed with one octave of Frequencies and then it is just a Doubling of each Frequency to get the next octave.

I provided one that will make one octave.

The Seed will need to create a generic key and then set the frequency.
The key would then create a generic note and set the frequency.
