Thoughts about a Piano Seed.
I do Not want to have to provide all the Notes I would like them created on the fly.

To get the correct frequencies
There is math that will do it captured in ScaleFrequencies.cpp.

Hard code the Seed with one octave (need reals not ints) of Frequencies and then
it is just a Doubling of each Frequency to get the next octave.
Convert Reals back to ints, this precision loss is acceptable.
Without reals each round of math will increase precision loss.

I provided one that will make one octave.

The Seed will need to create a generic key and then set the frequency.
The key would then create a generic note and set the frequency.
