1. get this working where as you build the music "sheet" you place random notation seeds as you go and see what you get.

2. Create a "music sheet" and then just make notes in the world and have them wander around and if they encounter a "music sheet" they will place themselves into it.

3. Have a "composer" object, that would wander around and if it encounters a "music sheet" it will compose a score into/onto it.
