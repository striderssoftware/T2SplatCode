
This was really just for fun, to practice splat code and to use Seeds to create objects.
The only interesting thing is that the objects that are used to "create" the tree die when they 
have finished their jobs. The Tree that is left is a collection of lights and really "knows" nothing about trees, least wise an XMasTree.

The Tree that is created cannot be Hacked to create a new tree, it does not have the code. 

but, this begs the question, the code to create an XMas tree lives somewhere on the system (XmasSeed.splat) so whatever created the XmasSeed
could be hacked to create a new XmasTree. hmmmm???
