Here is a link to first boot video:

--------
Startup:
Plug it in.

--------
General:
I found the tile to be much more robust then I had imagined. I could toss this accross the room to somebody.

The Hardware is facinating and I am not a hardware person.

It makes me want to go back and watch the early videos.

I want to setup a static IP for the Tile

------------
Connections:
Power: The ITC-PI connector can go on any of the six ITC connections. You just have to be careful to get the keying correct and get it seated properly.

I used the spot below the NE corner.

---------
Ethernet:
RJ45 was connected before boot.
(hmm, BeagleBoard Green's do not have Ethernet)

----
SSH:
Made a SSH connection with
SecureCRT
Looked at my DHCP table to find the ip.

Logged in and got a shell

-------
Serial:
Made a serial connection with
SecureCRT
same settings as to a Rasberry Pi
Logged in and got a shell

Question:
Boot information is (gibberish) until login prompt. ( and sometimes even the prompt ).
Shutdown -h now - information is readable and looks fine.

---------
Shutdown:
I used sudo shutdown -h now
Have yet to try a Power down


----
SDL:
The SDL is installed on the Beagle Bone
/usr/iclude/SDL
I will use apt-get install to install
the SDL2

SPACE:
it is pretty limited:

t2@beaglebone:~$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            214M     0  214M   0% /dev
tmpfs            49M  1.6M   47M   4% /run
/dev/mmcblk1p1  3.5G  3.0G  272M  92% /
tmpfs           242M     0  242M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs           242M     0  242M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs            49M     0   49M   0% /run/user/1001

The SDL2 is pretty small.I think it would fit.
I could always remove SDL.
