Ubuntu:
before connecting the USB serial adapter:
trider@ubuntu:~$ dmesg | grep tty
[    0.155883] printk: console [tty0] enabled
[    2.876652] 00:05: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A

After connecting:

strider@ubuntu:~$ dmesg | grep tty
[    0.155883] printk: console [tty0] enabled
[    2.876652] 00:05: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A

strider@ubuntu:~$

Mac:
ls /dev/tty* | grep usb
/dev/tty.usbserial-0001

---------------------------------
MiniCom:  ( From an Ubuntu VM ) :
-------

used this guide:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Minicom

This install worked fine with no dependecies:
sudo apt-get install minicom

the command minicom -s brings up the setup menu

my term env var is:
TERM=xterm-256color

MinCom settings
sudo minicom -s

go into:
Serial Port Setup

changed the serial settings to use:
serial  device : /dev/ttyUSB0
and both Hardware and Sofware Flow control to NO

did NOT change:
Bps/Par/Bits at 115200 8N1
accepted the above as the default.

Went in to the Modem and dialing menu and removed all
information in setting options A through I 

Was able to get a sucesfull login and shell to
a Raspery Pi.

---------------------------------
SecureCRT:  ( From a Mac ) :
----------
Same USB device as MiniCom
Same Serial settings as MiniCom

Port:
ls /dev/tty* | grep usb
/dev/tty.usbserial-0001

SecureCRT Port Setting:
/dev/cu.usbserial-0001

Was able to get a sucesfull login and shell to
a Raspery Pi.

-----------------------
changes to Rasberry Pi:

sudo raspi-config
into Interface Options ( different then guide )
and enabled all serial options  
(Enabled the login shell and the serial interface)

I used this guide but with noted changes.
