I made this while trying to get tunnel builder to work.
This will move east and if it hits a wall turn it into a number and continue on

= element TunnelBuilder
\symbol TB
\color #ff0


== Rules
given Z isa Wall{
. DebugUtils db;
. db.print("*****Z was a Wall");
. Number num;
. Wall wall;
. TunnelBuilder	tb;
. ew[$cursn] = tb;
. ew[1] = num;
.}

   @_ -> _@

   @Z -> @_

   @ -> @
