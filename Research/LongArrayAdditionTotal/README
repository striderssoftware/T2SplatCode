To get over the element size limit multiple arrays
are created with offsets to get the correct indices. They
"appear" as one long array spatially. But when computing
the total they each compute their own total and then the
total objects merge.

The setup to use this example:

Usage:
1. Create an array using the ArraySeed.
2. Run the simulator to get the array.
3. place the number seed above and to the left of the first grid spot.
4. place a Wall object one grid space away from far left of array. 

Example: (for each array)

a = array
s = number seed
w = wall object

  s
 w aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Result:
The numbers will walk the array placing their Values in the array if the correct index.
Each "section" of the array will compute its total and become an Adder object.
The adder objects will all merge with the grand total in it.
