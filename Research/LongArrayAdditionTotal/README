To get over the element size limit multiple arrays
are created with offsets to get the correct indices. They
"appear" as one long array spatially. But when computing
the total they each compute their own total and then the
total objects merge.

The setup to use this example:

Usage:
1. Create an array using the ArraySeed.
2. Run the simulator to get the array, and the stopper (the Wall object).
3. place the number seed above and to the right of the first array spot.

Example:

a = array
s = number seed
w = wall object

                            s
 w aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Result:
The numbers will walk the array placing their Values in the array if the correct index.
Each "section" of the array will compute its total and become an Adder object.
The adder objects will all merge with the grand total in it.
