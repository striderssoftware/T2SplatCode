The setup to use this example
A fairly contrived  setup, I agree :) 

1. Create an array using the ArraySeed.
2. Run the simulator to get an array.
3. place a number seed three grid places above the far array object.

Eample:

a = array
s = number seed

  s


  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Result:
The numbers will move down to the array
The numbers will walk the array placing their Values in the array if the correct index.
A total should be passed back left to the head, - array will shrink back to head.
the Head should have the total of all the numbers in its total field.
