To get over the element size limit array indices change into
array values.

The setup to use this example:

Usage:
1. Create an array using the ArraySeed.
2. Run the simulator to get the array, add the stopper (the Wall object).
3. place the number seed above and to the right of the first array spot.

Example:

a = array
s = number seed
w = wall object

                            s
 w aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Result:
The numbers will walk the array placing their Values in the array if the correct index.
The array index objects change into array value objects, The far right array value will turn into an
Adder object and add up all the array values.
The adder object will have the grand total in it.
