(Note: these are MY thoughts and may or may not be correct)
  My Understanding of the T2 Tile Project:

  The "real" world in which we operate has noise.
  Any complex (non trivial) system built upon it will have noise.

  The interface of a "hardware unit" (a T2 Tile) is whatever we want it to be.
  What we want it to be is open for discussion but the Harware Unit, or a Tile
  MUST accurately reflect any noise in the system. It must be HONEST. It must
  reflect the physics of the world in which it operates not attempt to provide
  a safer version to the layers above.

  It does not matter that the T2 Tile is Linux and RAM underneath.
  The interface a Hardware Unit exposes to the layers above is the blueprint
  for what a T2 Tile Hardware Unit will be.

  The T2 Projects current machine is a simulator to learn what an MFM machine will look like.

  The project wants to determine what "systems" will/can survive/arise when the Hardware Unit
  must expose system noise (the physics of the "real" world) in its interface.

  A process/program MUST be robust to survive in this "Mad Max" Universe.
  There can be NO Central Control in the MFM.
  System integerity is "enforced" by the "physics of the MFM"
  (Hopefully: by exposing the physics of the real world).

  The T2 Tile Project is embracing living system principles as the "system" that will/can
  survive/arise in this environment. living systems have already demonstrated
  the ability to thrive in the physics of the world in which they operate,
  a world with noise.

  [and in the spirit of the Sex Pistols]
  There is no need for a central control when the goal is anarchy.
