Create a self healing grid where the "units" or "squares" are bigger then the EventWindow.

Any Junction (S object) object will act as a seed to create a Grid accross the entire world.

If this grid is "nuked" it will heal.

The Grid is now a structured ForkBomb where the size can only be controled by limiting available resources (Res).
Perhaps this is how it should work, I dont know.

The same changes that make the Grid robust, make it difficult or impossible to bound the Total size of the grid..

With Large unit sizes the size of the "nuked" space is too small to have a big effect on a grid with large unit sizes,
perhaps this is a scaling issue, but I believe that for the parts of the grid that have been created only huge
end-to-end deletions can harm it.
